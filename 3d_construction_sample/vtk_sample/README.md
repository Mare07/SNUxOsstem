## 3D construction sample
- 3dfrom2dslices.py: A python sample based on VTK-7.0. Gives gray scale messy 3d. 
- MedicalDemo4.cxx: Downloaded .tar file from VTK examples site. It somehow renders much cleaner and fancier 3d model.
  > cd MedicalDemo4/build</br>
  (Don't forget to add the given sample.mha inside build folder.)</br>
  > cmake ..</br>
  > make</br>
  > ./MedicalDemo4 osstem_sample.mha
